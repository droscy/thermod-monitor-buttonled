Description: Thermod monitor for Raspberry Pi with one button and one RGB LED
 The LED reports the current status of Thermod, while the button can be
 used to change the status in a, almost, sequential way: from any status to
 'auto' and from 'auto' to 'tmax' on first pressing, then from 'tmax' to
 'off', from 'off' to 'tmin', from 'tmin' to 'antifreeze' and from
 'antifreeze' to 'auto'.
